Assignment: Background Color Changer

In this assignment, you will create a simple web app that changes the background color of the page when the user clicks a button. The app should display a button that, when clicked, generates a random color and updates the background to that color.
To complete this assignment, you will need to use the useEffect hook to update the state of your component whenever the user clicks the button.
Requirements:

1. Display a "Change Color" button on the screen.
2. When the user clicks the "Change Color" button, generate a random color (e.g. "#7F00FF") and set it as the background color of the page.
3. Use the useEffect hook to update the background color whenever the user clicks the "Change Color" button.
4. Style the app with CSS to make it look presentable and easy to use.
